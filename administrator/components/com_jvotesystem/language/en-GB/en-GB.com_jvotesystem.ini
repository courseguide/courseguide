JVOTESYSTEM_COMPONENT_DESC="The component jVoteSystem allows visitors to participate in surveys on your site. You can distribute as many votes as are available to you, thus you can emphasize on a certain answer. When set in component preferences, users can also create their own answers and help e.g. with the feature development. This program works with AJAX, meaning you don't have to reload the page, and is therefore more user friendly. In addition, administrators can manage the site in the frontend and users can remove their own posts. Also, the IP addresses and cookies are stored, which makes multiple voting difficult without permission. With the additional plugin (included in the package) you can also insert the poll into your posts. Language packs for German and English are included. Since the version 1.01, users can write comments on answers and the administrators can insert polls with a editor button. Ultimately, a very useful survey component with a user friendly, simple design."

JVS_ADV_ADVISOR="Troubleshooting"
JVS_ADV_HEAD="Using all the experience gathered during support of jVoteSystem we have composed a list of common pitfalls/error sources that prevent operation of jVoteSystem. Please make sure every tile is green! If there is no colour in the following, then already your browser is outdated ;-)"
JVS_ADV_PHP_DESC="jVoteSystem uses AJAX-Technology together with JSON-encoded data transfer. The latter requires at least PHP >= 5.2.0 which was released in 2006!"
JVS_ADV_JOOMLA_DESC="Although jVoteSystem should compatible with Joomla from 1.5 (latest version) to 2.5 (latest version), the development mainly takes place in Joomla 2.5 and 1.5 (only compatibility checks). Please consider the latest Joomla long-term branch (Joomla 2.5). We are not yet sure whether to drop support for Joomla 1.5 after April 2012, but at some point this will happen!"
JVS_ADV_COOKIE_DESC="jVoteSystem uses Cookie validation in order to prevent users from multiple voting. Every cookie has a path property which is either set by $cookie_path in global configuration.php (Joomla 1.6 and newer) or determined by JURI class as fallback in case $cookie_path is empty or does not exist (Joomla 1.5). This is only relevant when Joomla is installed in a subdirectory (i.e. www.domain.com/sub/) and a wrong setting will cause cookies to be valid for all Joomla installations of www.domain.com."
JVS_ADV_LIVESITE_DESC="The definition of $live_site in global configuration.php is only necessary if erroneous webserver configurations have to be overcome. In 99.9% of all cases Joomla is able to determine the $live_site parameter on its own. Unfortunately the default behaviour of some Joomla functions change when you set $live_site although it is not necessary. That's why this setting is no reachable within the Joomla backend. Please keep this parameter empty (if possible), despite some people like sh404sef devs suggest to set this variable."
JVS_ADV_SHAOA_DESC="sh404sef is an extension that takes over native Joomla SEF URL rewriting. Although we tried to make jVoteSystem as compatible as possible, there are some issues that have not been solved yet.If you experience error in combination with sh404sef, please verify if the error persists with sh404sef deactivated first and then ask for support in the official support forums. Thank you!"
